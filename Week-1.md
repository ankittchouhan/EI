  - 90-109 → Average
  - Below 70 → Mentally Retarded

### **Types of Intelligence Tests**
1. **Verbal Tests**: Based on words, reasoning.
2. **Non-Verbal Tests**: Picture-based, pattern recognition.
3. **Individual vs. Group Tests**: Conducted one-on-one or in groups.
4. **Speed vs. Power Tests**:
   - **Speed Test**: Time-limited.
   - **Power Test**: No time constraints, difficulty increases.
